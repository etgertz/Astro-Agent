Developed this game for the BU 2025 Game Jam from November 4 to November 21 to introduce myself to Godot.

All assets and sound effects were created by myself for this project.

Due to time constraints this is not my cleanest programming work, however it was something I really enjoyed getting to create!

Looking forward to building on my game development skills to create new and inspiring gameplay.
